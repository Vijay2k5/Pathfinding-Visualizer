  # Path-Finding Algorithm Visualizer

  This software is an interactive pathfinding visualization tool designed to demonstrate how various search algorithms navigate through a maze to find a path from a start point to a target point. It provides a real-time visual understanding of how algorithms explore, make decisions, and eventually reach the goal.

  The user can build custom mazes, place start and end nodes, choose an algorithm, and watch the search process unfold step-by-step. Each algorithm behaves differently, and the software allows users to compare them based on time taken, number of visited nodes, path length, and efficiency.

  It's an Educational Tool – Helps students learn how algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A* actually work internally.
  
  Can Compare Algorithms – Suitable for studying performance differences between uninformed and informed search techniques.
